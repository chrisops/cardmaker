# CardMaker

## What it do

I've needed to create prototypes for various board game/card game ideas, but can't find any web apps that do this

CardMaker is the first prototyping app on my roadmap 

## MVP feature set

[] Create a playing card
[] Add elements to the playing card
[] Render those elements
[] Add those cards to a deck of playing cards
[] Shuffle the deck of playing cards and drag and drop cards from the deck
